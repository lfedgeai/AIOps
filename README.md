# AIOps - for distributed environments and edge

AIOps under the LFEdge umbrella delivers AI supported operations for heterogeneous and complex edge environments.

 **In short: AegisEdgeAI makes it impossible for an AI workload to run on the wrong machine, in the wrong location, or in a compromised state — and cryptographically proves it.**

## Binding user, device, and workload identities from manufacture through runtime with geofencing enforcement

## Why it matters
- **Manage Complexity** – Distributed and heterogenous environments can be complex and hard to manage. Hece we are utilizing AI to help secure, fault-find and manage those environments.

- **Adopt** – Due to the vast differences distributed environments have wrt connectivity, workloads and general resource constraints, AIOps trains and finetunes the AI models 'on the job'

- **Scale** – Only AIOps can truly enable growing distributed environments to remain manageable and secure.
