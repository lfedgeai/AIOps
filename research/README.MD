# This is the home for all AIOps research initiatives.

## Description
The approach is pretty simple:
The home for all things AIOps research requires you to use the below template as a README.MD file in the top level directory in your research folder.

# Template
Please copy/paste your template

For all your approved research tasks, please use the below template in the top-level directory of your research project.


## 📌 Research Overview
* **Status:** `🏗️ In-Progress` / `✅ Complete & Peer-Reviewed` / `📦 Archived`
* **Domain:** [e.g., Unified Storage, Agentic AIOps Architectures, Event/Signal Correlation]
* **Core Question:** What is the primary reason eg "What if?" or "How?" driving this study?

## 🎯 Desired Outcomes
* **Primary Objective:** [e.g., To prove that $X$ is more efficient than $Y$ under constraints $Z$].
* **Key Deliverables:**
    - [ ] **Trained Weights:** Optimized model files for deployment.
    - [ ] **Cleaned Dataset:** Normalized data ready for replication.
    - [ ] **White Paper:** Formal documentation of findings.
    - [ ] **Visual Dashboard:** Interactive UI for results exploration.

## 🛠 Methodology & Framework
*Describe the technical approach and the "How" behind the research.*

* **Approach:** [e.g., Qualitative Analysis, Random Forest Regression, Double-Blind Study].
* **Core Logic:**
    $$L = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$
* **Tech Stack:** `Python (Pandas/NumPy)`, `R`, `LaTeX`, `Docker`.
